# Samhain-Blessings
Crowspeaks 
The viel is thinning, 
And winter is beginning, 
Samhain is here with it's magic and mist. 
Ancestors and healing. 
The 'old gods' revealing. 
Witches and firelight but here is the twist, 
The Wheel it is turning,
The planet is burning.
While we all post our greetings of love and light. 
The news is filling 
With war and with killing. 
Does your practice ignore it and spare you the sight? 
In the darkness ghosties lurking, 
While you do your working.
Where's your care for the world in that glittery woo? 
Do you give a shit, 
for the saf state of it? 
The changes we need should be starting with you.
